# azure-cosmosdb-spark-samples
The Apache Spark to Azure Cosmos DB connector enables Azure Cosmos DB to be an input or output for Apache Spark jobs. In this repo you will find code samples for connecting Spark to Azure Cosmos DB using azure-cosmosdb-spark connector. This accelerates your ability to solve fast-moving data science problems. You can use Azure Cosmos DB to quickly persist and query data. The connector efficiently uses the native Azure Cosmos DB managed indexes. The indexes enable updateable columns when you perform analytics and push-down predicate filtering against fast-changing, globally distributed data. This kind of data can range from Internet of Things (IoT) to data science and analytics scenarios
